# lunar-sample-provenance
This python program is a collection of codes from Calzada-Diaz et al. (2015) and Madera &amp; Gross (2021, 2022), designed to pair remote sensing chemical observations of the lunar surface with geochemical analyses of lunar samples as a way to constrainn where on the lunar surface may have originated from. This program will be made available upon publication.
